        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>The add and edit patterns work best when using a specialized view model class to help build the form. We refer to this as a "...Form" view model class, because we usually append "Form" to the end of the name.</p>

        <h2>Understanding SelectList</h2>
        <p>A SelectList object is a package of data that helps you build an item-selection control in an HTML Form.</p>
        <p>Here's how you create and use a SelectList:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Get/fetch/prepare the collection of items that will appear in the control.</li>
            <li>Ensure that you are using a "...Form" view model class, which has a SelectList property (name format is "...List").</li>
            <li>You must also have a second view model class, to describe the shape of the data that will be posted back by the browser user.</li>
            <li>In the controller method, create a "...Form" object.</li>
            <li>Configure its SelectList property with the collection, <u>and</u> the property names that will be used by the HTML "value" and "text" attributes.</li>
            <li>Send to the view.</li>
            <li>In the view, use the SelectList object in the HTML item-selection control.</li>
            <li>Ensure that the "name" attribute matches the property name in the post-back view model class.</li>
        </ol>
