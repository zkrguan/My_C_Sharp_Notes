        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>Some entities can have "self" assocations.</p>
        <p>This app's "Employee" entity has two self-referencing assocations:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To-one, used to indicate the supervisor (or boss/manager)</li>
            <li>To-many, used to indicate the collection of direct-reports</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2>Self-referencing to-one</h2>
        <p>In the design model class, this association REQUIRES two properties:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A property of the same type, to hold the associated object reference</li>
            <li>A nullable int, to hold the identifier of the associated object</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This approach is both REQUIRED and is a best practice for ASP.NET MVC web apps that use Entity Framework for data persistence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2>Self-referencing to-many</h2>
        <p>Configuring this association is exactly the same as configuring any other to-many association.</p>
