        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>The problem domain is the automotive industry:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Country entity, has many...</li>
            <li>Manufacturer entities, has many...</li>
            <li>Vehicle entities</li>

        <p>It is a security-aware app.</p>
        <p>This means that you must register for a new user account, and use it to perform certain vehicle-related tasks.</p>
        <p>You can also login as admin@example.com and Password123!</p>
        <p>Study the code in the Manufacturers and Vehicles controllers, to learn how role claims are used to control access to actions/methods.</p>
