        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>This code example shows some common patterns for working with many-to-many associations using <u>two (Employees and JobDuties) controllers.</u>.</p>
        <p>You have experience displaying the to-many end of associations.</p>
        <p>This example builds upon that, by enabling you to <u>edit</u> the to-many data.</p>
        <p>In addition, we work with both ends of the many-to-many association.</p>
