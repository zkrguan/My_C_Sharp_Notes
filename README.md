# My_C_Sharp_Notes

Before Java, I only used ts/js, C++, C, and Python. While learning C Sharp, I had to learn Java at the same time. Best way to keep myself not confused between two languages is to document everything properly.

Notes and Code examples are from profs at Seneca. And I reinterpreted, reorganized, and combined the words they said during the in-class sessions.

This note collection is made while learning asp.net MVC with C sharp.
